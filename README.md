# My-Python-Projects

### Project 1

#### SNAKE, WATER, GUN GAME
We all have played snake, water gun game in our childhood. If you haven’t, google the
rules of this game and write a python program capable of playing this game with the
user.


### Project 2

#### THE PERFECT GUESS


We are going to write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to
guess it.

If the player’s guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays “Lower
number please”. Similarly, if the user’s guess is too low, the program prints “higher
number please” When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the
number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.
